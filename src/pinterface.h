Page header structure
Id: page ID
Type: page type, including disk page, empty page record, key page, value page, usage record page of key page, etc
Different types of pages have different structures
Hitstamp: timestamp of page hit used for cache scheduling
Writestamp: time of writing to database, updated version, used to compare old and new data in AP process
Allocstamp: used to record the time of page creation, compare with the time of bitpage writing to the hard disk, and confirm that the relevant bitpage has been updated to the hard disk
Thread: the thread that last used the page
Event: the last event using the page is used to determine whether there is unsafe usage data.
Prevpage: the front page of a two-way linked list of the same type under the same table
NextPage: the next page of a two-way linked list of the same type under the same table
CRC: check bit of remaining data

Skip list
Compress the data as much as possible to avoid data wasting at 8 times the scale
Different levels of the same element must share the key in one page
Providing two-way linked list will provide more functions. Here, using one-way linked list can meet the needs
Jump table query does not need to go home, there is no need to reverse jump
Because the complexity of forward query and reverse query is the same
So there is no need to reverse query
Nexterelementpage: the page number of the next element
Nexterelementoffset: next element in page offset, in char
Highelementoffset: recall from bottom to top when deleting
Lowelementoffset: the page offset of the next level, in char
Currentlevel: the level of the current hop table is 0-7. If it is 0, the link of the previous hop table is required
Keyoffset: if the current level is 0, it is the intra page offset of key value, in char
